	abstract = {Tree visualization is one of the best-studied areas of information visualization; researchers have developed more than 200 visualization and layout techniques for trees. The treevis.net project aims to provide a hand-curated bibliographical reference to this ever-growing wealth of techniques. It offers a visual overview that users can filter to a desired subset along the design criteria of dimensionality, edge representation, and node alignment. Details, including links to the original publications, can be brought up on demand. Treevis.net has become a community effort, with researchers sending in preprints of their tree visualization techniques to be published or pointing out additional information.},
