\section{Motivation}

The	 goal	 is	 to	 visualize	 a	 hierarchical	 network	 with	 n	 Layers.	 Each	 Node	 in	 a	 graph	 can	
represent	a	graph	itself.	There	are	multiple	examples	where	this	has	been	visualised	in	2D,	
however	we	believe	that	with	an	additional	dimension	and	when	3D	graphs	are	analysed	in	
VR	we	can	get	even	more	insight	and	a	better	overview	of	the	data.	

Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example applications with hierarchical network data
    \item current 2D visualizations of hierarchical networks
    \item power of VR visualizations and board availability
\end{itemize}

\section{Aim of the Work}

Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item provide a prototype application
    \item take a look at current technologies (HTC VIVE, WEBXR/WEBVR) and frameworks(AFrame, THREEJS, D3-force(3d)) with its capabilities 
    \item experiment with different concepts/approaches
    \item experiment with different interactions
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
