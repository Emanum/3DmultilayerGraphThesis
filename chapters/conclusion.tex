\section{Future Work}
Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item refactor application with the knowledge of the learned mistakes, remove "Aframe-forcegraph-component" as we are not really using any feature now, use a clean dependency management
    \item port to newer version of A-Frame and Three-Js
    \item after upgrading A-Frame version optimize for other VR Headsets, Oculus Quest, ... 
    \item add hand gesture support
    \item optimize data structure (tree data structure  with optimized searched methods)
    \item experiment with different visibility of links/nodes/layers
    \item Add rotate and zoom interaction from paper Embodied Navigation in Immersive Abstract Data Visualization:
    Is Overview+Detail or Zooming Better for 3D Scatterplots?
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
